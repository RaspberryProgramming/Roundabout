 -  This module provides the "world's dumbest model of the store: the store is
 -  a list and a reference is number which denotes a position in the list."

 - Representation as a pair of references
 - Advanced Note: The references need not be stored near one another in
 - the free store; however, there are performance implications related
 - to memory locality if we do not keep these references proximal.
